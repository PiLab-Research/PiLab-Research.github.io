2020-11-07	 specific BERT representation for Named Entity Recognition of lab protocol	EMNLP | WNUT	Supervised models trained to predict properties from representations have been achieving high accuracy on a variety of tasks.For in-stance, the BERT family seems to work exceptionally well on the downstream task from NER tagging to the range of other linguistictasks. But the vocabulary used in the medical field contains a lot of different tokens used only in the medical industry such as the name of different diseases, devices, organisms,medicines, etc. that makes it difficult for traditional BERT model to create contextualized embedding. In this paper, we are going to illustrate the System for Named Entity Tagging based on Bio-Bert. Experimental results show that our model gives substantial improvements over the baseline and stood the fourth runner up in terms of F1 score, and first runner up in terms of Recall with just 2.21 F1 score behind the best one.

2021-01-07	Hostility Detection in Hindi leveraging Pre-Trained Language Models	Constraint workshop at AAAI	Hostile content on social platforms is ever increasing. This has led to the need for proper detection of hostile posts so that appropriate action can be taken to tackle them. Though a lot of work has been done recently in the English Language to solve the problem of hostile content online, similar works in Indian Languages are quite hard to find. This paper presents a transfer learning based approach to classify social media (i.e Twitter, Facebook, etc.) posts in Hindi Devanagari script as Hostile or Non-Hostile. Hostile posts are further analyzed to determine if they are Hateful, Fake, Defamation, and Offensive. This paper harnesses attention based pre-trained models fine-tuned on Hindi data with Hostile-Non hostile task as Auxiliary and fusing its features for further sub-tasks classification. Through this approach, we establish a robust and consistent model without any ensembling or complex pre-processing. We have presented the results from our approach in CONSTRAINT-2021 Shared Task on hostile post detection where our model performs extremely well with 3rd runner up in terms of Weighted Fine-Grained F1 Score.

2020-11-07	Leveraging Event Specific and Chunk Span features to Extract COVID Events from tweets	EMNLP | WNUT	Twitter has acted as an important source of information during disasters and pandemic, especially during the times of COVID-19. In this paper, we describe our system entry for WNUT 2020 Shared Task-3. The task was aimed at automating the extraction of a variety of COVID-19 related events from Twitter, such as individuals who recently contracted the virus, someone with symptoms who were denied testing and believed remedies against the infection. The system consists of separate multi-task models for slot-filling subtasks and sentence-classification subtasks while leveraging the useful sentence-level information for the corresponding event. The system uses COVID-Twitter-Bert with attention-weighted pooling of candidate slot-chunk features to capture the useful information chunks. The system ranks 1st at the leader-board with F1 of 0.6598, without using any ensembles or additional datasets.	Extract_COVID	https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.10052
2021-04-07	Spanish Pre-Trained Language Models for HealthCare Industry	Proceedings of the Iberian Languages Evaluation Forum	Currently transformer based model have shown high accuracy and good prediction on downstream tasks like Named Entity Recognition, Sentiment analysis etc. But the terminologies used in Healthcare sector such as names of different diseases, medicines and departments makes it difficult to predict with high accuracy. In this paper we are going to show a system for Named Entity tagging based on BETO (Spanish BERT). Experimental results have shown that our model gives better results than the current baseline of MEDDOPROF Shared task.	Spanish_bert	http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2943/meddoprof_paper7.pdf
