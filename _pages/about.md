We are a group of individuals interested in pushing the boundaries of research in NLP. We have worked on a variety of problems ranging from automatically detecting measurements from research articles, to detecting and mitigating propaganda from news articles.

We are currently trying to improve the robustness of CODE-QA, a novel question answering dataset for source code comprehension.
